# :school: School_District_Analysis :school:

## Purpose of Analysis: 
The City School District Board has requested analysis of the Standard Testing Scores for Math and Science across the district. They have requested multiple summaries of the data in order to plan for the coming school year. Also, there has been some evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math scores for Thomas High School 9th graders. The Board has requested that the scores be removed from the analysis and the summaries be adjusted to reflect the new values. This will help them make more appropriate assumptions about the schools for the decisions that they need to make for the coming year. 

> NOTE: In the following analysis, **Original** will refer to the data before any adjustments. **Adjusted** will refer to post removal of Thomas High School 9th grade scores, and THS will refer to Thomas High School.

## Results of District Analysis

1. How is the district summary affected?
    * As shown below in Table 1.1, the average scores in Math, as well as the % passing math, the % passing reading and the % overall passing *decreased* once the values were recalculated without the Thomas High School 9th grade scores.
    * The largest decrease was in % Passing Math, with a decrease of 0.35%, however, the % change from the adjustmes amounted to less than half a percent change to any of the metrics.
    * The remainder of the fields were not affected by the adjusted totals.
